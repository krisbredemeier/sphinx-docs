Learn how to integrate GoSquared's APIs with your website, web apps, mobile apps, and server-side code.

Getting Started
-----------------------------------------------------

GoSquared provides a Tracking API to send data to GoSquared, and multiple APIs for retrieving data in different forms – the Now and Trends APIs. We also have an Account API for performing actions on your GoSquared user account.


Tracking API
-----------------------------------------------------

The Tracking API allows you to track your visitors, users and customers on any platform or device. To get the most out of GoSquared, you need to integrate the Tracking API wherever you interact with your users.

Use the JavaScript Tracker for website and web app tracking.
For Node.js and PHP server-side apps, use our official node.js and PHP modules.
For tracking users on mobile devices, server-side apps written in other languages, and all other platforms, use Segment. GoSquared integrates seamlessly with Segment, and Segment supports all popular languages and platforms. Take a look at their libraries and plugins.
We've put together an integration guide to walk you through the process.

Now and Trends APIs
-----------------------------------------------------

The Now and Trends APIs give you programmatic access to all of the data you'll find in our Now, Trends and Ecommerce apps. Use these APIs to bring data into your own apps and services, and to build your own data visualisations on top of GoSquared's data.


Head over to the full API reference to grab all the information you need to build something amazing using GoSquared data. Check out GoSquared Labs for some data viz inspiration if you're stuck for ideas.
